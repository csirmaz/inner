    poly.c: 
        moving (some) documentation before definitions
        deleting 
           bitmaps M_facetpos, M_facetneg, FacetPositive, FacetNegative
           intersect_Fwork_with_vertex
           subtract_Fneg_from_Fliving
           clear_PosNegFacets
           add_PositiveFacet, add_NegativeFacet
        adding M_vertexlist as VertexList (size MaxVertices)
               M_facetposneg as FacetPosnegList (size MaxFacets)
        extending bitcount up to 1023 (10 bits) instead of 8
        squeezing facets to the beginning when we run out of space

    inner.c: print "non-default parameters" headline only if there
            was some change
        check that the number of objectives is at least 2.
        change R_info to R_warn

    params.c: set the default message level to 2 (don't show the
            eq: out: new:  values by default)
        added the undocumented keyword TrueRandom so we can test
            the speed of different optimizations

    main.c: changing the CTRL+C signal to USR1
