Version 1.5
 - Changing the default to ShowParams=1 and RandomFacet=1
 - When MessageLevel=3 the progress report shows three more
   values: how many facets go through the vertex just added
   (value after eq:), how many facets have been thrown (out:)
   and how many new facets are added (new:)
 - New heuristics added: keep a vertex pool and choose the
   vertex which produces the largest number of "out" facets.
   The value of the new keyword VertexPoolSize determines the
   size of the pool; the default value is 0, which means no
   pool.

Version 1.6
 - main.c: changing the SIGINT (Ctrl+C) signal to SIGUSR1
 - poly.c: moving documentation before the procedures
 - poly.c: new (and faster) method is implemented; thanks to
    Elod Csirmaz (https://github.com/csirmaz)
 - poly.c: extending bitcount to 1023 *(10 bits) from 8 bits
 - inner.c: print the "non-default parameters" headline only if there was
       some change
 - inner.c: check that the number of objectives is at least 2
 - inner.c: changing output channel from R_info to R_warn, and 
 - params.c: setting the default MessageLevel to 2
